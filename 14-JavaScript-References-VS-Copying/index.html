    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person}
    //
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
